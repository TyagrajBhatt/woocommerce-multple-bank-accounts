Add multiple bank transfer payment gateways.

== Description ==

By default, WooCommerce provides 1 bank transfer payment gateway for all your bank accounts. With this plugin, you can add up to 10 additional bank transfer payment gateways. So you can separate your bank accounts into multiple payment gateways, for example 1 payment gateway for 1 bank company.

Notes:
- On the screenshot you can see there are icons next to the payment gateway's name. You can add the icon using [Fr Custom Payment Gateway Icon for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fr-custom-payment-gateway-icon-for-woocommerce/) plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `fr-multi-bank-transfer-payment-gateways-for-woocommerce` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to *WooCommerce* &rarr; *Settings* &rarr; *Payments* &rarr; and enter the *number of additional bank transfer gateways*.
Refresh the page after saving this option. The additional bank transfer payment gateways will be added after the page has been refreshed.
